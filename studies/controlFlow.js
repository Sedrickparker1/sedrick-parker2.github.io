 The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
  Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line,
  unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, 
  such as conditionals and loops.

  EXAMPLE:

  if (condition) {

    control flow stops here 

    } else {
   
    control flow stops here if it doesnt stop in the
    first condition

 }

 Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

A set of statements is in turn generally structured as a block, which in addition to grouping, also defines a lexical scope.

Interrupts and signals are low-level mechanisms that can alter the flow of control in a way similar to a subroutine, but usually occur as a response to some external stimulus or event (that can occur asynchronously), rather than execution of an in-line control flow statement.

At the level of machine language or assembly language, control flow instructions usually work by altering the program counter. For some central processing units (CPUs), the only control flow instructions available are conditional or unconditional branch instructions, also termed jumps.
